            <p>Hello! I'm Adnane, an aspiring developer with a deep interest in web development and software engineering. I'm a computer science student based in Algeria, and over time, I've been gradually developing a genuine interest in how websites are built and how the technologies behind them come together to create interactive and functional experiences.</p>
            <p>
              I started following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">The Odin Project</a> last year, which has helped me build a solid foundation in web technologies and inspired me to pursue development more seriously.
            </p>

            <p>Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on several small projects that allowed me to apply and grow my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm hoping to continue learning, get deeper into the field, and eventually explore more advanced technologies as I progress.</p>
